# KappaGen
Shows emotes from your chat on screen

## Usage
To host the app, just serve the html and js files statically. You might want to edit your google analytics ID (or remove the GA block entirely), but that is up to you.

To use the app, go to http://cbenni.com/static/kappagen2/settings/ and edit your settings. Once that is done, grab your url and add it as a CLR Browser in OBS (or whatever streaming software you are using).
